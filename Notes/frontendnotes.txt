make text input for destination computer -> will trigger packet scanner to launch w that as params

What should they See
    -2 computers, info about them (ip address, who is target who is source)
    take out:
        type
        source
        destination
        protocol
        flag
        frag offset
        IHL
        verions
        TOS
        
    -show TCP flags
    -timestamp in front
    -TCP payload
    -make a pop up talking about what we do 
        -we scan for this on this using this
        -instructions on how to use as well
    -make arrow to show where packet went

What should they do
    type in IP address -> press Run 
What features are there
    -run 
        sends signal to start malpacket and packersniffer
        need to make it so that exe have sys env variables for IP addr

    -stop scan
        sends signal to stop all process runners
     
    -save (DONE)

What stats are there
    -anomaly vs normal 
    -packet size over time
    -packet frequency over time
    -true labels count (to be added)

DONE Make true labels diagram 
DONE Make code run with command line args (packet sniffer)
DONE Fix Traveled to Column 

Make Source and destination computers look better
Make logic for suspicious levels
Fix Packet Risk
Start collecting results for poster board and presentations
