Issue: AI model is not predicting any anomalies 
Risk: Actual malicious packets are going undetected bc model is predicting false negatives.
Possible Causes: 
-imbalanced dataset (true but it's supposed to be that way for iForest),
-thresholding issue (experiment w/ contamination)
-model bias or overfitting (try regulazation or improve feature engineering)

Adding risk scoring:
Use decision function which returns anomaly score
Higher scores indicate normality, while lower scores indicate anomalies.
Come up with plan to determine threshold
