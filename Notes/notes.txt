AI STUFF:
-supervised: kaggle dataset

-unsuperived 
    - dummy data we create -> 
        - flood attack (DOS)
        - malicious packet payload

- unsuperived live data 
    - go into model -> test and approve after 

-model selection 
    - random forest (baseline)
    - RESEARCH OTHER ONES 

- check for model accuracy & eval metrics (ways to know this is correct)

- risk score based on probability score -
    -> require research on what makes packet bad boy (metric of the packet) what probability rule to use


TYPES OF ATTACKS TO DETECT:
-DoS through FLOOD -> send packets at rapid fire
-Port spoofing -> send packet through wrong port for protocol


1. IP Header Fields:
Source IP Address: Check for known malicious IP addresses or IPs from suspicious geographic locations.

Destination IP Address: Ensure it matches expected destinations; unexpected destinations could indicate exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) traffic.

TTL (Time to Live): Unusual TTL values might indicate spoofing or tunneling.

Protocol: Ensure it is TCP (value 6); unexpected protocols could indicate encapsulation of malicious traffic.

IP Flags: Check for unusual fragmentation or reserved flag usage, which could be used in evasion techniques.

2. TCP Header Fields:
Source Port: Unusual or high-numbered ports might indicate malicious activity.

Destination Port: Ensure it matches expected services; unexpected ports could indicate scanning or exploitation attempts.

Sequence Number: Unusual patterns or out-of-order sequences might indicate spoofing or replay attacks.

Acknowledgment Number: Check for unexpected values, which could indicate tampering.

Flags (SYN, ACK, RST, FIN, PSH, URG):

SYN Flood: Excessive SYN packets without corresponding ACKs could indicate a SYN flood attack.

RST/FIN Scans: Excessive RST or FIN packets might indicate scanning or reconnaissance.

URG Flag: Unusual use of the URG flag could indicate an attempt to exploit certain vulnerabilities.

Window Size: Unusual window sizes might indicate evasion techniques or buffer overflow attempts.

Checksum: Verify the checksum to ensure the packet hasnâ€™t been tampered with.
