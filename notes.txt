-find a way to make a fake server that sends malicous packets to device

AI STUFF:
-supervised: kaggle dataset

-unsuperived 
    - dummy data we create -> 
        - flood attack (DOS)
        - malicious packet payload

- unsuperived live data 
    - go into model -> test and approve after 

-model selection 
    - random forest (baseline)
    - RESEARCH OTHER ONES 

- check for model accuracy & eval metrics (ways to know this is correct)

- risk score based on probability score -
    -> require research on what makes packet bad boy (metric of the packet) what probability rule to use
